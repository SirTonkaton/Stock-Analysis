# All Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help the user evaluate the performance of stocks through multiple years. Based on the given information for each stock, an individual will be able to select where we should invest to maximize their return. Keep in mind that while a stock may perform exceptionally in one year, the story can be completely different the following year. Therefore, it is important to know the historical rate of return of each stock.

## Let's compare the rate of return for the years 2017 and 2018 on the following stocks:

If we are to take into consideration the information presented and make an investment decision for the year 2019, ENPH and RUN seem to be the stocks with a multiyear return. That being said, it is important to notice that even though ENPH had a positive return for both years, on 2018 the rate of return decreased from 129% down to 81%. The 48% +/- change is a significant decrease. It will be a clever idea to do research and figure out what factors contributed to such change.

On the other hand, RUN went from 5% up to 83% rate of return. Knowing what good practices were followed to get such impressive results should be analyzed and shared so the results can be replicated.

So, a decision is to be made, invest on a stock that provides a return but seems to be on a decrease for the rate of return or to invest on the stock that seems to be on the rise? 

# Refactoring

## Advantages
When refactoring a code, we will find advantages and disadvantages of doing so. The biggest advantage of refactoring is that you improve the code itself. As we gain more experience on coding, innovative ideas, shortcuts or methods can be applied to make a task more efficient.

### See example below
As we will see below, the changes we make can make a code run in a less amount of time:

#### Timer - 2017 Before refactoring

#### Timer - 2017 After refactoring

#### Timer - 2018 Before refactoring

In the example above, refactoring the code sped up the process of getting the information. With this being a small amount of information to analyze, the difference in time is not relevant. However, we could make the argument that we knew the results a little bit sooner.

## Disadvantages
A disadvantage that I see with refactoring is that making changes often could become confusing. If we do not give a structure to the code, it will be hard to remember all the changes made, particularly if more than a couple changes were made the same day.
